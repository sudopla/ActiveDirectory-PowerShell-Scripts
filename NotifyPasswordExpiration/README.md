### NotifyPasswordExpiration

This PowerShell script can be used to notify no Windows users when their passwords are about to expire.
Sometimes you have a mixed environment where Mac or Linux users use Windows domain accounts to log in to their computer or other network resources. These users never get a message when their passwords need to be changed because of security policies, so this script will notify them sending an email.
